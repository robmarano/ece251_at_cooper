# MIPS 32-bit Processor Emulator in Verilog

The code in ```mips-simple.asm``` is machine encoded in memfile.dat.

To run this code, simply run the following command
on Linux or MacOS
```bash
make clean compile simulate
```
or on Windows
```batch
clean.bat
compile.bat
simulate.bat
```

Next iteration of this project will introduce the MIPS assembler.
